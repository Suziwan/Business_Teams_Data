# Business_Teams_Data
Week 3 Day 5 - Project: Understanding business teams by analysing their set of data

For each batch of data, we want to understand the essentials and assess the relevance of the data.
- Main data
  - What type of data (raw or aggregated)?
  - What are the indicators?
- Overall meaning of the dataset 
  - Who should be responsible for updating this dataset in business terms? 
  - Why is it interesting? 
  - What business trends does it reflect?
- Limits of the data set 
  - What data would be interesting to have in addition? 
  - Is there incomplete data? 
  - What questions would it be interesting to ask business teams to better understand the overall meaning?
